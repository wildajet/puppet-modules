puppet-modules
=======

Puppet modules from throughout the years.  Use at your own risk!

These modules were written against Puppet enterprise with YAML being used via Hiera and files being served from the Puppet fileserver.  
All files that a module references are being pulled from the fileserver and are not stored in the module
